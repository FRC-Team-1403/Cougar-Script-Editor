# Cougar-Script-Editor
Team 1403â€™s Cougar Scripting system is a robust system used to efficiently and clearly encode sequences of autonomous actions. Scripts are created by using the Cougar Script Editor, which is a drag and drop graphical user interface that allows for the creation and modification of cougar scripts as well as provides a preview of the projected actions of the robot. The script is then exported, interpreted, and executed by the robot. The system is easily adaptable to fit any type of game, field, robot, or command!
